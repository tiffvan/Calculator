# Calculator


This is a simple calculator that can help you with all your small calculation needs. A bonus feature being that you can veiw your history of answers from the calculations that you have made.

The process I took of making the app:
#1 Create a project in Xcode
#2 Create the user interface for both Calculator and History screens on the main storyboard
#3 Create functions for math equations using addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.
#4 Create a function to show "Error" when a number is divided by zero as that is not possible.
#5 Create a tableview to show the history of equation answers
#6 Create functions to save answers to the History screen in the tableview
#6 Create functions for memory save, recall and clear


Features:

#1 Doing math Equations

- 2_with_numbers

#2 Saving the answers to the History screen

#3 Memory functions, such as save and recall
